# FHE-based Blind Chess

Blind Chess is a revolutionary, privacy-preserving game that utilizes Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology to create an immersive chess experience. In this game, players can securely make moves while keeping their strategies hidden from their opponents, resulting in a fair and balanced competition.

## The Problem

Traditional chess games, whether online or in-person, expose players' strategies, making it susceptible to exploitation and unfair advantages. Cleartext data can reveal critical information about players' moves and strategies, leading to a lack of confidence in the game's integrity. This vulnerability not only detracts from the enjoyment of the game but also undermines the competitive spirit of chess.

## The Zama FHE Solution

Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) offers a groundbreaking approach to addressing these issues by allowing computations on encrypted data. This means that players' moves, game state, and strategies remain confidential throughout the entire game. Using Zama's powerful fhevm library, Blind Chess processes encrypted inputs, enabling players to validate their moves and maintain the integrity of the game without revealing their strategies.

## Key Features

- ♟️ **Encrypted Game State**: The entire chessboard state is encrypted, ensuring that opponents cannot gain insights into each other's strategies.
- 🔒 **Homomorphic Validation**: Validates moves on the encrypted state, confirming legality without disclosing information.
- 🎮 **Asymmetric Information**: Players can engage in strategic gameplay under a veil of privacy, enhancing the competitive experience.
- 📊 **Dynamic Strategies**: Each player's unique strategies remain hidden, allowing for innovative gameplay and tactics.
- 🌐 **Easy Access**: Play Blind Chess from anywhere, leveraging the security of Zama’s FHE technology.

## Technical Architecture & Stack

Blind Chess is built using a comprehensive stack designed to leverage Zama's cutting-edge technology for privacy:

- **Core Engine**: Zama’s fhevm for encrypted computations.
- **Frontend**: React for a responsive and engaging user experience.
- **Backend**: Node.js for seamless game logic and interactions.
- **Database**: Secure storage to manage player data and game states.

## Smart Contract / Core Logic

Here’s a simplified example of how the core logic leverages Zama's technology to process encrypted chess moves:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "path/to/TFHE.sol"; // Hypothetical import for TFHE library.

contract BlindChess {
    event MoveMade(uint64 playerId, uint64 move);

    function makeMove(uint64 encryptedMove) public {
        require(isValidMove(encryptedMove), "Invalid move");
        emit MoveMade(msg.sender, encryptedMove);
    }

    function isValidMove(uint64 encryptedMove) private view returns (bool) {
        // Homomorphic operation to validate the move.
        return TFHE.add(encryptedMove, 1) <= 64; // Example logic.
    }
}
```

This code snippet illustrates how encrypted moves are validated using homomorphic functions, ensuring security and integrity.
